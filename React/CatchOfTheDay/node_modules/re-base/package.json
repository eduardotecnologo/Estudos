Firebase makes persisting your data easy to implement. re-base, inspired by Relay, combines the benefits of React and Firebase by allowing each component to specify its own data dependency. Forget about your data persistence and focus on what really matters, your application's state.\n\n# Why re-base?\n\nI spent a few weeks trying to figure out the cleanest way to implement Firebase into my React/Flux application. After struggling for a bit, I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis33/status/605838057825132549) my frustrations. I was enlightened to the fact that Firebase and Flux really don't work well together. It makes sense why they don't work together, because they're both trying to accomplish roughly the same thing. So I did away with my reliance upon Flux and tried to think of a clean way to implement React with Firebase. I came across ReactFire built by Jacob Wenger at Firebase and loved his idea. Sync a Firebase endpoint with a property on your component's state. So whenever your data changes, your state will be updated. Simple as that. The problem with ReactFire is because it uses Mixins, it's not compatible with ES6 classes. After chatting with Jacob Turner, we wanted to create a way to allow the one way binding of ReactFire with ES6 classes along some more features like two way data binding and listening to Firebase endpoints without actually binding a state property to them. Thus, re-base was built.\n\n# Features\n\n- *syncState*: Two way data binding between any property on your component's state and any endpoint in Firebase. Use the same API you're used to to update your component's state (setState), and Firebase will also update.\n- *bindToState*: One way data binding. Whenever your Firebase endpoint changes, the property on your state will update as well.\n- *listenTo*: Whenever your Firebase endpoint changes, it will invoke a callback passing it the new data from Firebase.\n- *fetch*: Retrieve data from Firebase without setting up any binding or listeners.\n- *post*: Add new data to Firebase.\n- *removeBinding*: Remove all of the Firebase listeners when your component unmounts.\n- *reset*: Removes all of the Firebase listeners and resets the singleton (for testing purposes).\n\n# Installing\n\n```bash\n$ npm install re-base\n```\n\n# API\n\n#### For more in depth examples of the API, see the `examples` folder.\n\n## createClass(firebaseUrl)\n\n##### Purpose\n  Accepts a firebase URL as its only parameter and returns a singleton with the re-base API.\n\n##### Arguments\n  1. firebaseUrl:\n      - type: string\n      - The absolute, HTTPS URL of your Firebase project\n\n##### Return Value\n  An object with syncState, bindToState, listenTo, fetch, post, removeBinding, and reset methods.\n\n##### Example\n    var Rebase = require('re-base');\n    var base = Rebase.createClass('https://myapp.firebaseio.com');\n\n<br />\n\n## syncState(endpoint, options)\n\n##### Purpose\n  Allows you to set up two way data binding between your component's state and your Firebase. Whenever your Firebase changes, your component's state will change. Whenever your component's state changes, Firebase will change.\n\n#### Arguments\n  1. endpoint\n    - type: string\n    - The relative Firebase endpoint to which you'd like to bind your component's state\n  2. options\n    - type: object\n    - properties:\n      - context: (object - required) The context of your component\n      - state: (string - required) The state property you want to sync with Firebase\n      - asArray: (boolean - optional) Returns the Firebase data at the specified endpoint as an Array instead of an Object\n      - queries: (object - optional) Queries to be used with your read operations.  See [Query Options](#queries) for more details.\n      - then: (function - optional) The callback function that will be invoked when the initial listener is established with Firbase. Typically used (with syncState) to change `this.state.loading` to false.\n\n#### Return Value\n  An object which you can pass to `clearBinding` when your component unmounts to remove the Firebase listeners.\n\n#### Example\n    componentDidMount(){\n      base.syncState(`shoppingList`, {\n        context: this,\n        state: 'items',\n        asArray: true\n      });\n    }\n    addItem(newItem){\n      this.setState({\n        items: this.state.items.concat([newItem]) //updates Firebase and the local state\n      });\n    }\n\n<br />\n\n## bindToState(endpoint, options)\n\n#### Purpose\n  One way data binding from Firebase to your component's state. Allows you to bind a component's state property to a Firebase endpoint so whenever that Firebase endpoint changes, your component's state will be updated with that change.\n\n#### Arguments\n  1. endpoint\n    - type: string\n    - The relative Firebase endpoint that you'd like your component's state property to listen for changes\n  2. options\n    - type: object\n    - properties:\n      - context: (object - required) The context of your component\n      - state: (string - required) The state property you want to sync with Firebase\n      - asArray: (boolean - optional) Returns the Firebase data at the specified endpoint as an Array instead of an Object\n      - queries: (object - optional) Queries to be used with your read operations.  See [Query Options](#queries) for more details.\n\n#### Return Value\n  An object which you can pass to `clearBinding` when your component unmounts to remove the Firebase listeners.\n\n#### Example\n    componentDidMount(){\n      base.bindToState('tasks', {\n        context: this,\n        state: 'tasks'\n        asArray: true\n      });\n    }\n\n<br />\n\n## listenTo(endpoint, options)\n\n#### Purpose\n  Allows you to listen to Firebase endpoints without binding those changes to a state property. Instead, a callback will be invoked with the newly updated data.\n\n#### Arguments\n  1. endpoint\n    - type: string\n    - The relative Firebase endpoint which contains the data with which you'd like to invoke your callback function\n  2. options\n    - type: object\n    - properties:\n      - context: (object - required) The context of your component\n      - asArray: (boolean - optional) Returns the Firebase data at the specified endpoint as an Array instead of an Object\n      - then: (function - required) The callback function that will be invoked with the data from the specified endpoint when the endpoint changes\n      - queries: (object - optional) Queries to be used with your read operations.  See [Query Options](#queries) for more details.\n\n#### Return Value\n  An object which you can pass to `clearBinding` when your component unmounts to remove the Firebase listeners.\n\n#### Example\n    componentDidMount(){\n      base.listenTo('votes', {\n        context: this,\n        asArray: true,\n        then(votesData){\n          var total = 0;\n          votesData.forEach((vote, index) => {\n            total += vote\n          });\n          this.setState({total});\n        }\n      })\n    }\n\n<br />\n\n## fetch(endpoint, options)\n\n#### Purpose\n  Allows you to retrieve the data from a Firebase endpoint just once without subscribing or listening for data changes.\n\n#### Arguments\n  1. endpoint\n    - type: string\n    - The relative Firebase endpoint which contains the data you're wanting to fetch\n  2. options\n    - type: object\n    - properties:\n      - context: (object - required) The context of your component\n      - asArray: (boolean - optional) Returns the Firebase data at the specified endpoint as an Array instead of an Object\n      - then: (function - required) The callback function that will be invoked with the data from the specified endpoint when the endpoint changes\n      - queries: (object - optional) Queries to be used with your read operations.  See [Query Options](#queries) for more details.\n\n#### Return Value\n  No return value\n\n#### Example\n    getSales(){\n      base.fetch('sales', {\n        context: this,\n        asArray: true,\n        then(data){\n          console.log(data);\n        }\n      });\n    }\n\n<br />\n\n## post(endpoint, options)\n\n#### Purpose\n  Allows you to update a Firebase endpoint with new data. *Replace all the data at this endpoint with the new data*\n\n#### Arguments\n  1. endpoint\n    - type: string\n    - The relative Firebase endpoint that you'd like to update with the new data\n  2. options\n    - type: object\n    - properties:\n      - data: (any - required) The data you're wanting to persist to Firebase\n      - then: (function - optional) A callback that will get invoked once the new data has been saved to Firebase\n\n#### Return Value\n  No return value\n\n#### Example\n    addUser(){\n      base.post('users/${userId}', {\n        data: {name: 'Tyler McGinnis', age: 25},\n        then(){\n          Router.transitionTo('dashboard');\n        }\n      });\n    }\n\n<br />\n\n## removeBinding(ref)\n\n#### Purpose\n  Remove the listeners to Firebase when your component unmounts.\n\n#### Arguments\n  1. ref\n    - type: Object\n    - The return value of syncState, bindToState, or listenTo\n\n#### Return Value\n  No return value\n\n#### Example\n    componentDidMount(){\n      this.ref = base.syncState('users', {\n        context: this,\n        state: 'users'\n      });\n    }\n    componentWillUnmount(){\n      base.removeBinding(this.ref);\n    }\n\n<br />\n\n## reset()\n\n#### Purpose\n  Removes every Firebase listener and resets all private variables. Used for testing purposes.\n\n#### Arguments\n  No Arguments\n\n#### Return Value\n  No return value\n\n<br />\n\n## <a name='queries'>Queries</a>\n\nUse the query option to utilize the [Firebase Query](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/retrieving-data.html#section-queries) API.  For a list of available queries and how they work, see the Firebase docs.\n\nQueries are accepted in the `options` object of each read method (`syncState`, `bindToState`, `listenTo`, and `fetch`).  The object should have one or more keys of the type of query you wish to run, with the value being the value for the query.  For example:\n\n``` javascript\nbase.syncState('users', {\n  context: this,\n  state: 'users',\n  asArray: true,\n  queries: {\n    orderByChild: 'iq',\n    limitToLast: 3\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThe binding above will sort the `users` endpoint by iq, retrieve the last three (or, three with highest iq), and bind it to the component's `users` state.  NOTE: This query is happening within Firebase.  The *only* data that will be retrieved are the three users with the highest iq.\n\n## <a name='auth'>Authentication</a>\n\nre-base exposes [Firebase's web client](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/user-auth.html#section-login) `authWithPassword`, `authWithOAuthPopup`, `authWithOAuthRedirect` methods to allow user authentication.\n\n``` javascript\n// Via email / password\nbase.authWithPassword({\n  email    : 'bobtony@firebase.com',\n  password : 'correcthorsebatterystaple'\n}, authHandler);\n\n// Or via popular OAuth providers (\"facebook\", \"github\", \"google\", or \"twitter\")\nbase.authWithOAuthPopup(\"<provider>\", authHandler);\nbase.authWithOAuthRedirect(\"<provider>\", authHandler);\n```\n\nCalling unauth() logs the user out\n\n``` javascript\nbase.unauth()\n```\n\nYou may use the onAuth() method to listen for authentication events\n\n```\n// Create a callback which logs the current auth state\nfunction authDataCallback(authData) {\n  if (authData) {\n    console.log(\"User \" + authData.uid + \" is logged in with \" + authData.provider);\n  } else {\n    console.log(\"User is logged out\");\n  }\n}\n// Register the callback to be fired every time auth state changes\nvar ref = new Firebase(\"https://<YOUR-FIREBASE-APP>.firebaseio.com\");\nref.onAuth(authDataCallback);\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nre-base is inspired by ReactFire from Firebase.
